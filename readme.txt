This plugin will display a historical information of your myScoop blog ranking.

== Description ==

This plugin connects directly to myScoop and pulls information regarding your blog. The information is then stored in a data file on your server and only updated once a day to ensure quick loading times. You can now display either a graph of your rank history, or a big rank button.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `myscoop-rank.php` and the sub directories to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place the 'myScoop Rank Tracker' widget into one of your sidebars
4. Input the information required in the widget

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can someone display my stats on their blog? =

No, I have put strict security measures in place with this plugin. myScoop will double check that the original location of the request is matched to the blog ID that you specify. If not, the information will not be sent.
